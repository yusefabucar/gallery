#### Extra notes
- The images used in the gallery are located (referenced) in the Photos.js file in the 'src' folder. 
- Simply replace the image url src in the file to add your own images.
- The 'width' and 'height' are aspect ratio dimensions (width: 1, height: 1 = square; width: 16, height: 9 = widescreen/HD, and so on).
